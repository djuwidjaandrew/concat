this one is for feature identification
dummy placeholder hub for openCV color logging
to identify objects (should make rats of 3gridlength and different color combinations to log onto JSON)
to then identify their parametres

and the cat agent would appropiate the speed prediction
with jumping length (of choice) (initially overboard)
and refine it as it goes along  (a la free energy)

also has a mechanism of the rat panicking in low hp thus the jumps become
inadequate; and the cat would realize and try to update (heighten)
the predictions (there are open ports for the MBLR / RxInfer parts)
but currently is using just the simple prediction update rules
