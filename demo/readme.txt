Hi, updating this demo with zip's of the executable
currently they are:
(all are currently only a depiction without actual learning)

1. mblr for whack-a-rat  (depiction of FE minimization)
2. mblr for whack-a-many-rat (depiction of FE minimization from At-ease -> Panic -> At-ease again)
3. demo environment and color logging 
(intended for bush color preference due to hunting success; and updates which color-logged bush
is preferred to approach); (but currently no such action plan yet (substituted with hardcoded preference))
(should be a simple which-bush preference by color logging + associated food in the bundled / nested modRoam checker)

4. demo environment for cat modulating jump distance;
based on prediction of rat's burst of speed
(FE -> selection of jump length)

5. demo of action-plan refining of initial modRoam

much thanks! expect updates to be done within 03/11/2024
