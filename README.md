Hi;
these are depictions of the silly cat project
notable py's to run are:

prop/ folder = each .py to run 
(FE minimization and ease-panic-ease depictions)

10161 = main.py
10171 = main.py
the game worlds to describe either bush preference
(color logging = association ; running under [foodplau] epi on modroam)
(171 = FE minimization to do object feature calibration; for jump distances)

also
wpy.zip at demo
